# GitLab

This workshop is performed on a shared GitLab instance. You have been assigned a user and password for this instance in an email.

## Task 1: Retrieve your credentials digitally

You have received your credentials in an email but the password is not fun to type in. Let's retrieve it digitally:

1. Go to [https://code.inmylab.de](https://code.inmylab.de)
1. Select your username from the list
1. Login using your personal user `seatN` (where `N` is a number) and your code (looks like this `ABCDEF`)
1. The web page displays your credentials

Keep the page open to refer to your credentials anytime throughout the workshop.

## Task 1: Access your instance of Visual Studio Code

1. Go to `https://seatN.vscode.inmylab.de` where `N` is a number.
1. Login using your personal user `seatN` (where `N` is a number) and your password

The password is the same as your GitLab password.

??? info "Hint (Click if you are stuck)"
    Your username looks like `seatN` where `N` is a number.

    Your password is a long, random string which is displayed on the web pages access in the previous chapter.
