### Imperative approach

Scripts and applications

Implement full logic for the task at hand

### Declarative approach

Textual description of a desired state

Engine makes adjustments to reach desired state

### Challenges

Engine for implement changes

Independent implementation with ecosystem

Large user base provide security
