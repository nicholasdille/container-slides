### Keyless Signature Flow

*cosign* creates a temporary key pair <i class="fa fa-circle-1"></i> and requests a certificate from *fulcio* <i class="fa fa-circle-2"></i>.

The clients gets redirected to authenticate <i class="fa fa-circle-3"></i>, *fulcio* issues a short-lived certificate <i class="fa fa-circle-4"></i> based on the authentication data.

*cosign* updates the transparency log *rekor* <i class="fa fa-circle-5"></i>

After signing, the key pair as well as the certificate are deleted <i class="fa fa-circle-6"></i>.

## Signature verification

Verification still requires trust

Cosign verifies if a valid signature is present

Tell cosign what metadata to accept (who has authenticated where)

### Integration

Kyverno has support builtin

### Attention

Bootstrapping the tooling is important

Check the supply chain of required tools
