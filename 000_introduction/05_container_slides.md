## Container Slides

Slides and demos live on GitHub [nicholasdille/container-slides](https://github.com/nicholasdille/container-slides)

### Slides

Events have their own [release](https://github.com/nicholasdille/container-slides/releases)...

...with tag for date of event (`YYYYmmdd`)

Use the release tag to access files because...

...slide decks will be removed after a few months
