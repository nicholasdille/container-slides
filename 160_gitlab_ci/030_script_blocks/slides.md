## Script blocks

## Script blocks

`script` represents the core steps performed by a job

`script` is just a YAML string

GitLab also supported YAML herestrings [](https://yaml-multiline.info/):

```yaml
job_name:
  script: |
    pwd
    whoami
    printenv
```

Some jobs require preparation and cleanup to work correctly

```yaml
job_name:
  before_script: echo before_script
  script: echo core
  after_script: echo after_script
```

`after_script` runs even if the job failed (useful for cleanup)
