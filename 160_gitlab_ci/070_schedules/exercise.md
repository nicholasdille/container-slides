    - schedule a pipeline run
    - use a schedule to execute a preconfigured pipeline

## Task: Create a schedule

Create a schedule to run a 5 minutes on the branch `main` in the correct timezone. See the official documentation for [schedules](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/schedules.html).

Afterwards check the pipeline in the GitLab UI. You should see a successful pipeline run.

## Bonus task: Start a schedule manually

Run the previously created schedule manually by clicking the play button :fontawesome-solid-play:. This comes in handy if you need to run a pipeline with pre-configured variables.

Afterwards check the pipeline in the GitLab UI. You should see a successful pipeline run.
