# You are ready!

A few last words...

## Exercises tell a story :fontawesome-solid-timeline:

Each chapter focuses on a single feature

Each exercise improves the previous state

All exercises will have leave some questions unanswered

Following exercises will again improve

## Work at your own pace

Either follow topics and exercises at the instructor's pace

Or work ahead if you finish early

Please be mindful of other participants

Please do not confuse participants with your questions when racing ahead
