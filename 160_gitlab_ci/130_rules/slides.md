## Rules

---

## Make jobs conditional

Rules [](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules) define whether to execute a job

At least one successful rule for the job to be executed

```yaml
job_name:
  rules:
  - if: $VAR == "value"
  - if: $VAR2 = "value2"
  #...
```

Formerly `only`/`except` [](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#only--except) which are "not actively developed"

Official documentation of job control [](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/job_control.html)

## Hands-On: Rules [<i class="fa fa-comment-code"></i>](https://github.com/nicholasdille/container-slides/tree/130_rules "130_rules")

Run the `deploy` job only for the `main` branch

1. Create folder `public` in repository
1. Add files from `public/` to new folder `public`
1. Update `.gitlab-ci.yml`
1. Check pipeline
1. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**
1. Open URL for pages
1. Create branch
1. Check pipeline

See new `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```bash
git checkout 130_rules -- '*'
```

Also see GitLab Pages [](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/index.html)

## Make pipelines conditional

Workflow rules [](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#workflow) define whether to execute a whole pipeline

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
  - if: $VAR == "value"
  - if: $VAR2 = "value2"

job_name:
  #...
```

Conditions are also used in workflow rules

## Hands-On: Workflow rules

Disable execution for some trigger types

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
  - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'push'
  - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'web'
  - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'schedule'
  - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'
  - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'pipeline'
  - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'api'
    when: never
  - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'trigger'
    when: never
```

## Pro tip: Rule templates

Pipelines often have many jobs

Rules will be repeated multiple times

Combine rules with templates to prevent repetition

```yaml
.rule-only-web:
  rules:
  - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'web'

job_name:
  extends:
  - .rule-only-web
  #...
```
